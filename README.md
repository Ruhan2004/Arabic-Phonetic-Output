# Arabic-Phonetic-Output
You can input the phonetic version of any Arabic text here. This software will show you output in Arabic (with vowels).

Ex- for getting "بِسْمِ ٱللّٰهِ ٱلرَّحْمٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيْمِ", you have to type "bismi allAhi alrraHmAni alrraHiymi" as input.

<b>Tips:</b><br>
• The key below 'esc' key (`) will return ع<br>
• Single Quote (') will return ء (Hamza)<br>
• Pronounciation of "Tanween" confuses with "Jazam over ن". To get rid of this problem, follow this example: "AHaduN" will return "أَحَدٌ" but "AHadun
" will return "أَحَدُنْ"<br>
• Press 'ctrl+c' to copy the output. You don't need to select the arabic text.
